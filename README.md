# Decision-Tree
Implement the decision tree learning algorithm using Information gain heuristic and Variance impurity heuristic

Instructions to execute:
1. make 						       (This will compile the program)
2. java ProgramDT training-set validation-set test-set to-print 	(This will generate both the inorder and out-of-order output_file)
3. make clean 						(Optional : This will clean compiled .class files)

Output of the program:
1. if <to-print> is 'yes' then Program will print Trees using both Heuristic and respective accuracies
2. if <to-print> is 'no' then Program will print accuracies of DT for both Heuristics
